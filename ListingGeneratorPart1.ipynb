        "This is the first step in an ongoing process; the eventual goal is to create a model that will generate a description of a home that can be used in the listing to sell that home.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a first step, I'm using the tutorial here (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/beginners-guide-to-text-generation-using-lstms) to generate a basic word-level LSTM network to generate text based on a small sample of listings.  Subsequent work is going to build on this toy model to create the actual model.\n",

        "Future innovations (listed here so I can reference this list later, listed in no particular order): \n",

        "\n",
        "1.   add a data generator for the model: This tutorial will be useful https://stanford.edu/~shervine/blog/keras-how-to-generate-data-on-the-fly\n",
        "2.   Experiment with cleaning the data in different ways. I don't want individual phone numbers, for example, treated as tokens, because that's going to increase the number of features by a lot.\n",
        "3. Relatedly, use a word2vec model for vectorization.  \n",
        "4. Also relatedly, think more about how to handle certain named entities, like for example, specific bodies of water referenced in the listing (e.g., \"This house sits on the shore of Lake Whatever\", including \"Lake Whatever\" there probably isn't going to generalize well.)\n",
        "5. Incorporate other features, like number of bedrooms, whether or not the property has a pool, etc. from the listings.  My plan is to feed these features in along with the word vectors and see if that helps direct the output to be more reflective of a specific property.  However, I think in order to gauge how well this works, I'll need relatively cogent text coming out of the model.  If the output is gibberish, it is hard to evaluate whether it more accurately describes like a multi-family victorian-style house or a one-story bungalow, if that makes sense.\n",
